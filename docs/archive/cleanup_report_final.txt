## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. IMMEDIATE: Remove all CRITICAL examples (automated by this script)

2. MANUAL REVIEW: Check HIGH severity examples for false positives
   Export with: --export-review flag

3. NEW LABELS NEEDED:
   - IP_Fragmentation
   - IP_SLA_TWAMP
   - OVERLAY_VXLAN_EVPN
   - SDWAN_Filtering
   - SDWAN_UTD
   - WIRELESS_MDNS

4. RETRAIN: After cleanup, retrain LoRA adapter on cleaned data
